	abstract = {Introduction: The urban road traffic accident (RTA) risks for the city of Zagreb, Croatia, from 1999 through 2000 were analyzed with the aim of reducing the increasing injury incidence. Method: Simple and bivariate analysis using χ2, odds ratio, and confidence interval of 95\% was used to determine risks in three outcome groups: killed, severely, and mildly injured. Results: There were 528 RTA victims consisting of 260 severely, 213 mildly injured, and 55 killed at the scene of an accident and during transportation. More fatal accidents occurred during night hours (OR=3.78; 95\% CI, 2.08–6.85), on urban road links (OR=2.33; 95\% CI, 1.30–4.19), and at exceeding speed limit (OR=2.56; 95\% CI, 1.43–4.61). More people were injured than killed on urban junctions (OR=5.27; 95\% CI, 2.21–12.57). The highest combined risk of dying or being severely injured was found in males, driving at excessive speed, on urban links, and during bad visibility (OR=16.15; 95\% CI, 3.901–66.881). Conclusion: These results will influence the urban traffic police enforcement measures, which will change inappropriate behavior of drivers and protect the least experienced road users.},

	abstract = {Road traffic accidents are one among the world's leading causes of injuries and fatalities and hence represent an important field of research towards the use of traffic accident analysis and prediction techniques and the determination of the most key factors contributing to road traffic accidents. This paper aims to provide an overview of road accident data sources, data analysis techniques, various algorithms used to build road accident forecasts, and also their suitability to the types of data being examined with the ease of interpretation. The paper also summarizes the operational problems of road traffic, identifies the risk factors, the efficacy of road safety measures when they contribute to the statistical analysis of the severity of motor vehicle accidents and offers an assessment of future methodological approaches. In this review, different gaps in the road traffic accident area were found and further fields of research have been mentioned.},

	abstract = {One of the major problems in the world today is the rate of road traffic crashes and deaths on our roads. Majority of these deaths occur in low-and-middle income countries including Nigeria. This study analyzed road traffic crashes in Anambra State, Nigeria with the intention of developing accurate predictive models for forecasting crash frequency in the State using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and autoregressive integrated moving average with explanatory variables (ARIMAX) modelling techniques. The result showed that ARIMAX model outperformed the ARIMA (1,1,1) model generated when their performances were compared using the lower Bayesian information criterion, mean absolute percentage error, root mean square error; and higher coefficient of determination (R-Squared) as accuracy measures. The findings of this study reveal that incorporating human, vehicle and environmental related factors in time series analysis of crash dataset produces a more robust predictive model than solely using aggregated crash count. This study contributes to the body of knowledge on road traffic safety and provides an approach to forecasting using many human, vehicle and environmental factors. The recommendations made in this study if applied will help in reducing the number of road traffic crashes in Nigeria.},

	abstract = {Road transportation is a statutory organ in a modern society; however it costs the global economy over a million lives and billions of dollars each year due to increase in road accidents. Researchers make use of machine learning to detect and predict road accidents by incorporating the social media which has an enormous corpus of geo-tagged data. Twitter, for example, has become an increasingly vital source of information in many aspects of smart societies. Twitter data mining for detection and prediction of road accidents is one such topic with several applications and immense promise, although there exist challenges related to huge data management. In recent years, various approaches to the issue have been offered, but the techniques and conclusions are still in their infancy. This paper proposes a deep learning accident prediction model that combines information extracted from tweet messages with extended features like sentiment analysis, emotions, weather, geo-coded locations, and time information. The results obtained show that the accuracy is increased by 8\% for accident detection, making test accuracy reach 94\%. In comparison with the existing state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed algorithm outperformed by achieving an increase in the accuracy by 2\% and 3\% respectively making the accuracy reach 97.5\% and 90\%. Our solution also resolved high-performance computing limitations induced by detector-based accident detection which involved huge data computation. The results achieved has further strengthened confidence that using advanced features aid in the better detection and prediction of traffic accidents.},
